# Instructions
There will be a Roslyn path error when built. To fix this, run the command "Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r" in the package manager console.
Other than that, the application should build normally and the database should generate when the first sequence is added.
